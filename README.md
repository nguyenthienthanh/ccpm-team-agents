## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended) ⭐

Install directly in Claude Code using the official plugin system:

```bash
# Install from GitHub repository
/plugin install https://github.com/nguyenthienthanh/ccpm-team-agents

# Verify installation
/agent:list
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One-command installation
- ✅ Automatic updates from GitHub
- ✅ Official Claude Code integration
- ✅ No manual file copying

**Alternative (if added to official marketplace):**
```bash
# If CCPM is listed in Claude Code official marketplace
/plugin install ccpm-team-agents
```

**Post-Installation Setup:**
```bash
# Configure integrations (optional)
# Edit .claude/.envrc for JIRA, Figma, Slack, Confluence
source .claude/.envrc
```

#### Option 2: Automated Installation Script

Use the installation script to automatically copy `.claude` to your project and configure environment variables:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/nguyenthienthanh/ccpm-team-agents.git
cd ccpm-team-agents

# Run installation script
./install.sh /path/to/your/project

# Or run interactively (script will prompt for project path)
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- ✅ Copy `.claude` directory to your project root
- ✅ Prompt you for environment variables (Jira, Confluence, Slack, Figma)
- ✅ Create `.claude/.envrc` with your configuration
- ✅ Create `.claude/settings.local.json` from template

**Note:** All sensitive files (`.envrc`, `settings.local.json`) are automatically git-ignored.

#### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nguyenthienthanh/ccpm-team-agents.git
cd ccpm-team-agents
```

2. Copy the `.claude` directory to your project root:
```bash
cp -r .claude /path/to/your/project/
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
cp .claude/.envrc.template .claude/.envrc
# Edit .claude/.envrc and fill in your values
```

4. Create local settings:
```bash
cp .claude/settings.example.json .claude/settings.local.json
# Edit .claude/settings.local.json if needed
```

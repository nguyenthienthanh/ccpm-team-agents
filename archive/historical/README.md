These files served their purpose during the configuration optimization phase but are no longer needed for day-to-day operations. They're preserved here for:

1. **Historical Reference** - Track what changes were made and why
2. **Audit Trail** - Document the evolution of the configuration system
3. **Learning** - Future contributors can understand past decisions

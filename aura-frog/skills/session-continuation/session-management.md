# Skill: Session Continuation

**Purpose:** Manage workflow state across sessions with handoff and resume
**Priority:** HIGH
**Auto-invokes:** When token limit approaching, session ending, or resuming workflow
**Type:** Skill (Dynamic Execution)

---

## When This Skill Activates

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Token count reaches 150K (75%) | Suggest handoff |
| User says "handoff" / "save state" | Execute handoff |
| User says "resume" + workflow ID | Execute resume |
| Session about to end | Auto-save state |
| User returns to incomplete workflow | Prompt to resume |

---

## Handoff Flow

### Step 1: Detect Need for Handoff

```yaml
Triggers:
  - Token count: >= 150,000 (75% of 200K limit)
  - User request: "handoff", "save", "pause"
  - Long workflow: Phases 1-4 complete, starting Phase 5

Auto-prompt:
  "⚠️ Token usage is at 75%. Would you like to save workflow state for continuation in a new session?"
```

### Step 2: Save Workflow State

**State File Location:** `.claude/logs/workflows/[workflow-id]/workflow-state.json`

**State Content:**
```json

### Step 3: Generate Handoff Summary

**Output to User:**

```markdown
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔄 WORKFLOW HANDOFF COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 **Workflow ID:** feature-auth-20251129-143022

📊 **Progress:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Requirements Analysis - Approved
- ✅ Phase 2: Technical Planning - Approved
- ⏭️ Phase 3: UI Breakdown - Skipped (backend-only)
- ✅ Phase 4: Test Planning - Approved
- 🔄 Phase 5a: Write Tests - In Progress

📁 **State Saved:**
`.claude/logs/workflows/feature-auth-20251129-143022/workflow-state.json`

📦 **Deliverables Created:**
- requirements.md
- tech-spec.md
- architecture.md
- test-plan.md

🔑 **Key Decisions:**
- Using JWT with refresh tokens
- Storing sessions in Redis
- bcrypt for password hashing

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
📥 **TO RESUME IN NEW SESSION:**

Type: `workflow:resume feature-auth-20251129-143022`

Or copy this command:
```
workflow:resume feature-auth-20251129-143022
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Resume Flow

### Step 1: Parse Resume Command

```yaml
Input: "workflow:resume feature-auth-20251129-143022"
       "resume feature-auth-20251129-143022"
       "continue workflow feature-auth-20251129-143022"

Extract: workflow_id = "feature-auth-20251129-143022"
```

### Step 2: Load Workflow State

```yaml
Load: .claude/logs/workflows/[workflow-id]/workflow-state.json

Validate:
  - File exists
  - JSON is valid
  - Version compatible
  - Status is "paused" or "waiting_approval"
```

### Step 3: Restore Context

```yaml
Actions:
  1. Load project context (project-contexts/[project]/)
  2. Activate saved agents
  3. Load phase-specific rules
  4. Restore key decisions
  5. Load deliverables created so far
```

### Step 4: Show Resume Summary

```markdown
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔄 WORKFLOW RESUMED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 **Workflow:** feature-auth-20251129-143022
📝 **Task:** Implement user authentication with JWT

📊 **Restored State:**
- Current Phase: 5a - Write Tests (TDD RED)
- Primary Agent: backend-nodejs
- Tech Stack: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL

✅ **Completed Phases:**
- Phase 1: Requirements Analysis ✓
- Phase 2: Technical Planning ✓
- Phase 3: UI Breakdown (skipped) ✓
- Phase 4: Test Planning ✓

🔑 **Key Decisions Restored:**
- Using JWT with refresh tokens
- Storing sessions in Redis
- bcrypt for password hashing

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⏭️ **CONTINUING FROM:** Phase 5a - Write Tests

Ready to continue writing tests for authentication.

Type "continue" to proceed or "status" for more details.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Step 5: Continue Execution

```yaml
On "continue":
  1. Resume from saved phase
  2. Show agent banner
  3. Execute remaining phase steps
  4. Show approval gate when phase complete
```

## Commands

### workflow:handoff

**Syntax:** `workflow:handoff`

**Action:** Save current workflow state and generate resume instructions.

### workflow:resume

**Syntax:** `workflow:resume <workflow-id>`

**Action:** Load saved workflow state and continue from last phase.

### workflow:list

**Syntax:** `workflow:list`

**Action:** Show all saved workflows with status.

**Output:**
```markdown
📋 Saved Workflows:

## Auto-Save Behavior

### When Auto-Save Triggers

```yaml
Events:
  - Phase completion (before approval gate)
  - Every 5 minutes during active work
  - Token count milestones (100K, 150K, 175K)
  - Before any external system write
```

### Auto-Save is Silent

```yaml
Behavior:
  - No user notification for routine saves
  - Only notify at warning thresholds
  - State file updated in background
```

## State File Management

### File Location

```
.claude/logs/workflows/
├── feature-auth-20251129-143022/
│   ├── workflow-state.json      # Current state
│   ├── requirements.md          # Phase 1 deliverable
│   ├── tech-spec.md            # Phase 2 deliverable
│   └── test-plan.md            # Phase 4 deliverable
├── bugfix-login-20251128-091500/
│   └── ...
└── README.md                    # Index of workflows
```

### Cleanup Policy

```yaml
Auto-cleanup:
  - Completed workflows: Keep 30 days
  - Cancelled workflows: Keep 7 days
  - Paused workflows: Keep indefinitely

Manual cleanup:
  - Command: workflow:cleanup
  - Removes old completed/cancelled workflows
```

---

## Error Handling

### State File Not Found

```markdown
❌ Workflow not found: feature-auth-20251129-143022

Possible reasons:
- Workflow ID is incorrect
- State file was deleted
- Workflow was never saved

Available workflows:
[list recent workflows]

To start a new workflow: `workflow:start <task>`
```

### Corrupted State File

```markdown
❌ Cannot load workflow state: Invalid JSON

Attempting recovery...
- Found backup: workflow-state.backup.json
- Restored from backup (15 minutes old)

⚠️ Some recent progress may be lost.

Continue with restored state? (yes/no)
```

### Version Mismatch

```markdown
⚠️ Workflow was created with Aura Frog v0.9.0
Current version: v1.0.0

Attempting migration...
✅ State migrated successfully

Continue? (yes/no)
```

---

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Handoff before token limit (at 150K)
- Include workflow ID in task tracking
- Resume promptly to maintain context
- Review key decisions after resume

### DON'T:
- Wait until 200K tokens (may truncate)
- Delete state files manually
- Resume with different project context
- Skip the resume summary review

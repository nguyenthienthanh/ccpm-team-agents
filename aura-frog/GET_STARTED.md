## ⚡ Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Claude Code** — Follow [Anthropic's installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
2. **Start Claude Code** — Run `claude` in your terminal

### Step 1: Install Aura Frog Plugin

In the Claude Code terminal, run these commands:

**Add Aura Frog Marketplace (one-time):**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add nguyenthienthanh/aura-frog
```

**Install Aura Frog Plugin:**
```bash
/plugin install aura-frog@aurafrog
```

**That's it!** Aura Frog is now installed globally and available in all your Claude Code projects.

---

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Check that Aura Frog commands are available:
```bash
/help
```

You should see Aura Frog commands like:
- `workflow:start` - Start 9-phase workflow
- `workflow:status` - Check workflow progress
- `agent:list` - Show all available agents
- `bugfix:quick` - Quick bug fix
- `project:init` - Initialize project context

---

### Step 3: Initialize (Optional)

Configure for your project:

```
In Claude Code chat, type:

project:init
```

This will:
- Detect your project type
- Configure integrations (JIRA, Confluence, Slack)
- Set up team reviewers
- Create project-specific config

**Or skip and use defaults** - Aura Frog works out of the box!

---

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### Test 1: Check Status
```
workflow:status
```

**Expected:** "No active workflow found" or current workflow status

---

### Test 2: Start Simple Task

**🆕 Using Skills (Natural Language):**
```
Analyze the current component structure
```

**Or using command:**
```
workflow:start Analyze the current component structure
```

**Expected:**
- **agent-detector** skill auto-invokes → Selects appropriate agent
- **workflow-orchestrator** skill auto-invokes → Starts 9-phase workflow
- Claude analyzes your code
- Shows Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- Displays approval gate
- Waits for your response

---

### Test 3: Approve and Continue
```
workflow:approve
```

**Expected:**
- Proceeds to Phase 2: Technical Planning
- Shows next approval gate

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Setup

### Add to .gitignore

```bash
# Aura Frog - Exclude sensitive workflow data
logs/contexts/
logs/
workflow-state.json
.env
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Create `.env` for integrations:

```bash
# JIRA Integration
JIRA_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"
JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token"

# Confluence Integration
CONFLUENCE_EMAIL="${JIRA_EMAIL}"
CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN="${JIRA_API_TOKEN}"

# Slack Integration
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
```

**Security:** Never commit `.env` file!

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. You Give a Command
```
workflow:start Refactor MyComponent
```

### 2. Claude Detects Command
- Reads `CLAUDE.md` for instructions
- Loads `commands/workflow/start.md`
- Activates relevant agents (dev, QA, UI designer)

### 3. Executes 9-Phase Workflow
```
Phase 1: Requirements Analysis → [Approval Gate]
Phase 2: Technical Planning → [Approval Gate]
Phase 3: Design Review → [Approval Gate]
Phase 4: Test Planning → [Approval Gate]
Phase 5: Implementation (TDD: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) → [Approval Gates]
Phase 6: Code Review → [Approval Gate]
Phase 7: QA Validation → [Approval Gate]
Phase 8: Documentation → [Approval Gate]
Phase 9: Notification → [Auto-complete]
```

### 4. You Control Every Step
At each approval gate:
- Review deliverables
- Type `workflow:approve` to continue
- Type `workflow:reject <reason>` to redo
- Type `workflow:modify <changes>` to adjust

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Claude doesn't recognize commands?

**Try being explicit:**
```
Please execute the workflow command: workflow:start <task>

Follow the steps in commands/workflow/start.md
```

### Need to reconfigure?

```
project:init
```

Choose "Reset configuration" option.

### Want to see all agents?

```
agent:list
```

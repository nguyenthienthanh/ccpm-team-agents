# Approval Gates Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Define approval gate format and usage in Aura Frog workflows
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-26

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Approval gates ensure user control and oversight at critical workflow checkpoints. Claude must ALWAYS show approval gates and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## 🚦 When to Show Approval Gate

**REQUIRED for:**
- ✅ After every phase completion
- ✅ Before code generation
- ✅ Before file modifications
- ✅ Before external system writes (JIRA, Confluence, Slack)

**NOT REQUIRED for:**
- ❌ Reading files or gathering information
- ❌ Analyzing code or documentation
- ❌ Research and exploration tasks

## 📋 Approval Gate Format (v1.0.0)

### New Friendly Format

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏗️ Phase 2: Design - Approval Needed
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## We've designed the solution! ✨

*"How will we build it?"*

**👤 Agents Working:**
- 🎯 **Primary:** mobile-react-native (Lead Developer)
- 🤝 **Cross-Review:** qa-automation (Testability Check)
- 🎨 **Consulting:** ui-designer (Component Guidance)

**🤖 System:** Aura Frog Team Agents v5.0
**📋 Mode:** Workflow Phase Execution

---

**What We Did:**
[Brief summary of design decisions]

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Technical Design Document
- ✅ Architecture Diagram
- ✅ Component Structure

**Key Decisions:**
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]
- [Decision 3]

**Cross-Review:**
- ✅ QA Agent (qa-automation): Testability confirmed ✓
- ✅ Secondary Dev: Code structure approved ✓

**Next Phase:** Phase 3: UI Breakdown 🎨
**Next Agent:** ui-designer (Primary)
We'll analyze the UI and break it into components.

**Token Usage:**
- This phase: 2,450 tokens (~2.5K)
- Total used: 5,230 / 200,000 (2.6%)
- Remaining: 194,770 tokens

---

**Options:**
- "approve" → Continue to Phase 3 (UI Breakdown)
- "reject: [reason]" → Redesign with feedback
- "modify: [changes]" → Adjust specific parts

⚡ After approval, I'll AUTO-CONTINUE to Phase 3!

### Legacy Format (Still Supported)

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIRED: Phase 2 Technical Planning
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Phase 2 Complete: Technical Planning

**Summary:**
[Brief overview of what was done]

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ [file1.md] - [description]
- ✅ [file2.md] - [description]

**Preview:**
[Show key content or code snippets]

**Cross-Review Status:**
- ✅ Dev Review: Approved
- ✅ QA Review: Approved

**Next Steps:**
[What happens after approval]

**Token Usage:**
- Phase tokens: [X] tokens (~[Y]K)
- Total used: [A] / 200,000 ([B]%)
- Remaining: [C] tokens

---

**Options:**
- "approve" → [IMMEDIATELY execute next phase]
- "reject: [reason]" → [Restart phase]
- "modify: [changes]" → [Adjust deliverables]

**⚡ After approval, I will AUTO-CONTINUE to next phase without waiting!**

**⚠️ Token Limit:**
- Cursor session limit: **200,000 tokens**
- At 150K tokens (75%): Show handoff warning
- At 160K+ tokens (80%): Recommend workflow:handoff
```

## 🗣️ Valid User Responses

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `approve` / `yes` / `approved` | Proceed to next phase & AUTO-CONTINUE |
| `proceed` | Execute code generation & AUTO-CONTINUE |
| `reject: <reason>` | Restart phase with user feedback |
| `modify: <instructions>` | Adjust deliverables without full restart |
| `stop` / `cancel` | Cancel workflow immediately |

---

## ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE Behavior

**After user approves:**
1. ✅ IMMEDIATELY execute next phase
2. ✅ No waiting for next user prompt
3. ✅ Continue through phases until:
   - Implementation complete (Phase 5c)
   - User rejection
   - Blocking error
   - Token limit reached
4. ✅ Show token usage at each phase completion

**Benefits:**
- Faster workflow completion
- Reduced back-and-forth
- Maintains momentum
- User retains control via approval gates

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**NEVER auto-approve:**
- ❌ External system writes
- ❌ Code deployment
- ❌ Database modifications
- ❌ File deletions
- ❌ Security-sensitive operations

**ALWAYS require explicit approval for:**
- ✅ Committing code
- ✅ Publishing packages
- ✅ Modifying production configs
- ✅ Accessing external APIs
- ✅ Writing to shared resources

---

## 📊 Token Tracking in Approval Gates

### Why Track Tokens?

**Purpose:**
- Prevent session timeout
- Enable timely handoff
- Maintain workflow continuity
- User awareness of resource usage

### Token Limits

| Session Type | Limit | Handoff Warning | Critical |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **Cursor** | 200,000 | 150,000 (75%) | 160,000 (80%) |
| **Standard Claude** | 200,000 | 150,000 (75%) | 160,000 (80%) |

### Display Format

```markdown
**Token Usage:**
- This phase: 2,450 tokens (~2.5K)
- Total used: 5,230 / 200,000 (2.6%)
- Remaining: 194,770 tokens
```

### Handoff Recommendation

When reaching 160K tokens:

```markdown
⚠️ **Token Usage Alert**

Current usage: 162,450 / 200,000 (81.2%)

**Recommendation:** Consider using `workflow:handoff` to save progress and continue in new session.

**Options:**
1. Continue (may hit limit soon)
2. Handoff now (safe option)
3. Complete current phase then handoff
```

## ✅ Best Practices

### For Claude

1. **Always wait** for explicit approval
2. **Never skip** approval gates
3. **Clear communication** of what's being approved
4. **Show preview** of changes when possible
5. **Explain next steps** clearly

### For Users

1. **Review carefully** before approving
2. **Use "modify"** for small adjustments

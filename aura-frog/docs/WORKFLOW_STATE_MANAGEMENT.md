# 🗂️ Workflow State Management

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Purpose:** Manage multiple concurrent workflows

---

## 📊 Overview

Aura Frog v1.2+ supports **multiple concurrent workflows** with independent state management.

---

## 🏗️ State Structure

### Previous (Single Workflow)

```
<your-project>/
└── workflow-state.json  ❌ Only one workflow at a time
```

**Problem:** Can't have multiple workflows simultaneously

### Current (Multi-Workflow)

```
<your-project>/
├── active-workflow.txt              → Current active workflow ID
└── .claude/logs/
    └── workflows/
        ├── workflow-1/
        │   ├── workflow-state.json  ← Workflow 1 state
        │   └── execution.log
        ├── workflow-2/
        │   ├── workflow-state.json  ← Workflow 2 state
        │   └── execution.log
        └── workflow-3/
            ├── workflow-state.json  ← Workflow 3 state
            └── execution.log
```

**Benefits:**
✅ Multiple workflows simultaneously  
✅ Each workflow has independent state  
✅ Easy to switch between workflows  
✅ No state conflicts

## 🎮 Workflow Management

### List All Workflows

```bash
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh list

# Output:
📋 All Workflows:

⏳ add-user-authentication [ACTIVE]
   ID: add-user-authentication-20251124-120000
   Phase: 5/9 | Status: in_progress
   Created: 2025-11-24T12:00:00Z

✅ refactor-userprofile
   ID: refactor-userprofile-20251124-110000
   Phase: 9/9 | Status: completed
   Created: 2025-11-24T11:00:00Z

⏸️  add-dark-mode
   ID: add-dark-mode-20251124-130000
   Phase: 2/9 | Status: initialized
   Created: 2025-11-24T13:00:00Z
```

### Switch Workflow

```bash
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh switch [workflow-id]

# Or in Claude
workflow:switch add-dark-mode-20251124-130000
```

### Load Workflow State

```bash
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh load [workflow-id]

# Returns JSON state
```

### Delete Workflow

```bash
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh delete [workflow-id]

# Confirmation required
```

### Archive Workflow

```bash
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh archive [workflow-id]

# Creates .tar.gz archive
```

---

## 🔄 Workflow Lifecycle

### 1. Create Workflow

```bash
workflow:start "Add user authentication"

# Creates:
# - .claude/logs/workflows/add-user-auth-20251124-120000/
# - .claude/logs/workflows/add-user-auth-20251124-120000/
# - Sets as active workflow
```

### 2. Work on Workflow

```
# All commands operate on active workflow
workflow:status
workflow:progress
workflow:approve
# etc.
```

### 3. Switch Workflows

```bash
# Start another workflow (pauses current)
workflow:start "Refactor UserProfile"

# Now "refactor-userprofile" is active
# Previous workflow is paused

# Switch back
workflow:switch add-user-auth-20251124-120000
# Now "add-user-auth" is active again
```

### 4. Complete Workflow

```
# After Phase 9 completion
workflow-state.json → status: "completed"
# Remains in .claude/logs/ for reference
```

### 5. Archive/Delete

```bash
# Archive old workflows
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh archive [old-workflow-id]

# Delete if not needed
bash scripts/workflow/workflow-manager.sh delete [workflow-id]
```

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### Concurrent Development

**Scenario:** Working on multiple features

```bash
# Feature 1: Authentication
workflow:start "Add authentication"
# ... work on Phase 1-2 ...

# Feature 2: Dark mode (while waiting for auth review)
workflow:start "Add dark mode"
# ... work on Phase 1 ...

# Switch back to auth
workflow:switch add-authentication-20251124-120000
# Continue auth workflow
```

### Handoff & Resume

**Scenario:** Token limit reached

```bash
# Session 1
workflow:start "Large refactoring"
# ... Phase 1-4 complete (150K tokens) ...
workflow:handoff

# Session 2 (new chat)
workflow:resume large-refactoring-20251124-100000
# Loads state from .claude/logs/workflows/[id]/
# Continues seamlessly
```

### Parallel Teams

**Scenario:** Multiple developers

```bash
# Dev 1: Feature A
workflow:start "Feature A"

# Dev 2: Feature B
workflow:start "Feature B"

# Each has independent state
# No conflicts!
```

---

## 🔀 Git Branch Tracking

### Why Branch Tracking is Critical

When working on multiple workflows, each may be on a different branch:

```
Workflow 1: feature/user-auth     (Phase 5)
Workflow 2: feature/dark-mode     (Phase 2)
Workflow 3: fix/login-crash       (Phase 7)
```

**Without branch tracking:**
- Resume to wrong branch → Code conflicts
- Lost commits → Work duplication
- Uncommitted changes lost → Progress lost

### Automatic Branch Management

**On Workflow Start:**
```bash
# Agent automatically captures:
git branch --show-current      → initial_branch
git rev-parse HEAD             → initial_commit
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{u} 2>/dev/null  → remote tracking
```

**At Each Phase:**
```bash
# Agent logs git state:
- Current branch
- Commit before/after phase
- Any uncommitted changes
```

**On Handoff:**
```bash
# Agent creates backup:
git stash push -m "workflow-handoff-[workflow-id]"
git branch backup/[workflow-name]-[timestamp]
```

### Resume with Branch Verification

**On Resume, Agent Will:**

1. **Check Current Branch**
   ```bash
   current=$(git branch --show-current)
   expected="feature/user-auth"

   if [ "$current" != "$expected" ]; then
     echo "⚠️ Branch mismatch detected!"
   fi
   ```

2. **Offer Recovery Options**
   ```markdown
   ⚠️ **Branch Mismatch Detected**

   **Expected:** feature/user-auth
   **Current:** main

   **Options:**
   1. `checkout` → Switch to feature/user-auth
   2. `continue` → Continue on current branch (may cause conflicts)
   3. `review` → Show branch differences first
   ```

3. **Verify Commit History**
   ```bash
   # Check if expected commits exist
   git log --oneline | grep "def5678"
   ```

---

## 📋 Change Log Tracking

### What Gets Tracked

| Category | Data | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Files Created | Path, phase, commit, lines | Know what was built |
| Files Modified | Path, phase, diff summary | Track changes |
| Files Deleted | Path, phase, reason | Avoid recreation |
| Commits | Hash, message, phase | Git history mapping |

### Change Log Structure

```json
{
  "change_log": {
    "files_created": [
      {
        "path": "src/auth/Login.tsx",
        "phase": 5,
        "commit": "def5678",
        "lines": 150,
        "checksum": "sha256:abc..."
      }
    ],
    "files_modified": [
      {
        "path": "src/App.tsx",
        "phase": 5,
        "commit": "def5678",
        "diff_summary": "+15 -3",
        "changes": "Added AuthProvider wrapper"
      }
    ],
    "total_stats": {
      "files_touched": 12,
      "lines_added": 450,
      "lines_removed": 20,
      "commits_made": 5
    }
  }
}
```

### Resume Comparison

**On Resume, Agent Shows:**

```markdown
📊 **Changes Since Handoff**

**Git Status:**
- Branch: feature/user-auth ✅ (same)
- Commits: 2 new commits since handoff

**File Changes:**
- ✅ src/auth/Login.tsx (unchanged)
- ⚠️ src/App.tsx (modified externally)
- ❌ src/auth/types.ts (deleted!)

**Options:**
- `continue` → Proceed with current state
- `diff` → Show detailed differences
- `restore` → Restore from backup
```

---

## 🔧 Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Branch Deleted

```markdown
❌ **Recovery Required: Branch Not Found**

**Expected Branch:** feature/user-auth
**Status:** Branch does not exist

**Recovery Options:**

1. **Restore from backup branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-auth backup/user-auth-20251124-130000
   ```

2. **Restore from remote:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-auth origin/feature/user-auth
   ```

3. **Start fresh:**
   - Deliverables preserved in: `.claude/logs/workflows/[id]/`
   - Can recreate code from deliverables
```

### Scenario 2: Commits Missing/Rebased

```markdown
⚠️ **Recovery Required: Commit History Changed**

**Expected Commit:** def5678
**Status:** Commit not found (possibly rebased)

**Recovery Options:**

1. **Check reflog:**
   ```bash
   git reflog | grep "def5678"
   ```

2. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   git checkout backup/user-auth-20251124-130000
   ```

3. **Continue from current:**
   - Review change_log for what was done
   - Manually verify files exist
```

### Scenario 3: Uncommitted Changes Lost

```markdown
⚠️ **Recovery Required: Uncommitted Work**

**At Handoff:** 2 uncommitted files
- src/auth/Login.tsx
- src/auth/AuthContext.tsx

**Current Status:** Files not found

**Recovery Options:**

1. **Restore from stash:**
   ```bash
   git stash list | grep "workflow-handoff"
   git stash apply stash@{0}
   ```

2. **Restore from backup directory:**
   ```bash
   cp .claude/logs/workflows/[id]/backup/src/auth/* src/auth/
   ```

3. **Regenerate from deliverables:**
   - Phase 5 deliverables contain code specs
   - Can regenerate implementation
```

### Scenario 4: Complete Repository Loss

```markdown
🚨 **Critical Recovery: Repository Not Found**

**Workflow:** add-user-authentication
**Status:** Project directory not found or not a git repo

**Recovery Options:**

1. **Deliverables Preserved:**
   ```
   ~/.claude/logs/workflows/[workflow-id]/
   ├── deliverables/          ← All phase outputs
   ├── HANDOFF_CONTEXT.md     ← Full context
   └── backup/                ← Code snapshots
   ```

2. **Recovery Steps:**
   - Clone repository fresh
   - Create branch from base
   - Use deliverables to guide reimplementation
   - Or copy backup files directly

3. **Partial Recovery:**
   - Requirements, specs, test plans preserved
   - Can restart from Phase 5 with existing planning
```

---

## 🛡️ Backup Strategy

### Automatic Backups

**On Handoff:**
```bash
# 1. Create backup branch
git branch backup/[workflow]-[timestamp]

# 2. Stash uncommitted changes
git stash push -m "workflow-handoff-[id]"

# 3. Copy changed files to backup dir
cp -r src/ .claude/logs/workflows/[id]/backup/src/

# 4. Save git state
git log --oneline -20 > .claude/logs/workflows/[id]/backup/git-log.txt
git diff HEAD > .claude/logs/workflows/[id]/backup/uncommitted.patch
```

### Backup Locations

```
.claude/logs/workflows/[workflow-id]/
├── backup/
│   ├── src/                    ← Source code snapshot
│   ├── git-log.txt             ← Recent commits
│   ├── uncommitted.patch       ← Uncommitted changes
│   └── file-checksums.json     ← For verification
├── RECOVERY.md                 ← Recovery instructions
└── workflow-state.json         ← Full state
```

### Recovery Priority

| Priority | Source | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Git branch | Branch exists, commits intact |
| 2 | Backup branch | Main branch modified |
| 3 | Stash | Uncommitted changes lost |
| 4 | Backup directory | Git history corrupted |
| 5 | Deliverables | Complete loss, rebuild needed |

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Name Workflows Clearly

```bash
# Good
workflow:start "Add JWT authentication"
workflow:start "Refactor UserProfile component"
workflow:start "Fix login crash on iOS"

# Bad
workflow:start "Update stuff"
workflow:start "Changes"
```

### 2. One Active Workflow

**At any time:**
- One workflow = ACTIVE (being worked on)
- Others = PAUSED (saved state)

**Switch when:**
- Waiting for review
- Need to work on urgent fix
- Token limit approaching

### 3. Clean Up Completed

```bash
# After workflow complete
workflow:status  # Verify completed

# Archive for reference
bash workflow-manager.sh archive [id]

# Or delete if not needed
bash workflow-manager.sh delete [id]
```

### 4. Use Handoff for Long Workflows

```bash
# At 150K tokens
workflow:handoff

# New session
workflow:resume [id]
# State loads from .claude/logs/workflows/[id]/
```

---

## 🔧 Migration

### From Single State (Old)

**If you have `workflow-state.json`:**

```bash
# Move to new structure
mkdir -p .claude/logs/workflows/legacy-workflow
mv workflow-state.json \
   .claude/logs/workflows/legacy-workflow/workflow-state.json

# Set as active
echo "legacy-workflow" > active-workflow.txt
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Active Workflow Pointer**
   - Always check `active-workflow.txt` first
   - Commands operate on active workflow
   - Switch with `workflow:switch`

2. **State Independence**
   - Each workflow has separate state
   - No cross-workflow interference
   - Safe to run concurrently

3. **Token Tracking**
   - Per-workflow token tracking
   - Independent limits
   - Each workflow starts fresh

4. **Handoff & Resume**
   - State persists in `.claude/logs/workflows/[id]/`
   - Resume loads from there
   - No dependency on single state file

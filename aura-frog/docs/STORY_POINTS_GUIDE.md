# Story Points Estimation Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27

## Overview

Story points are a unit of measure for expressing the overall effort required to fully implement a feature or task. Aura Frog uses the Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation.

---

## Fibonacci Scale

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
```

**Why Fibonacci?**
- Reflects increasing uncertainty at higher estimates
- Forces meaningful differentiation
- Prevents false precision
- Industry standard in Agile teams

---

---

## Story Point Components

Story points account for:

### 1. Effort (40%)
- How much work is needed?
- How many files to change?
- How much code to write?

### 2. Complexity (30%)
- How hard is the logic?
- How many edge cases?
- How intricate is the solution?

### 3. Uncertainty (20%)
- How many unknowns?
- How familiar is the tech?
- How stable are requirements?

### 4. Risk (10%)
- What can go wrong?
- How critical is the code?
- How hard to test?

---

## Estimation Process

### Phase 1: Initial Rough Estimate
- Based on requirements understanding
- High-level complexity assessment
- Confidence: Low to Medium
- Purpose: Planning and prioritization

### Phase 2: Detailed Estimation
- After technical design
- Component-level breakdown
- File change count known
- Confidence: Medium to High
- Purpose: Sprint planning

### Refinement During Implementation
- Adjust as unknowns are resolved
- Update if scope changes
- Retrospective for accuracy

---

## Story Point Breakdown by Phase

For an **8-point task** (Complex):

```yaml
Total: 8 points

Breakdown:
  Phase 1 (Understand): 0.5 points
  Phase 2 (Design): 1 point
  Phase 3 (UI Breakdown): 0.5 points
  Phase 4 (Plan Tests): 1 point
  Phase 5a (Write Tests): 1.5 points
  Phase 5b (Implementation): 2.5 points
  Phase 5c (Refactor): 0.5 points
  Phase 6 (Code Review): 0.25 points
  Phase 7 (QA Verification): 0.25 points
  Phase 8 (Documentation): 0.5 points
  Phase 9 (Share): 0 points (automated)
```

**Note:** Phase breakdown is for planning only. Story points represent total effort.

---

## Converting Story Points to Hours

**⚠️ Important:** Story points are NOT hours. However, teams often convert for planning.

### Team Velocity Based Conversion

**Example Team Velocity:** 1 point = 2 hours

| Story Points | Time Estimate |
|--------------|---------------|
| 1 point | ~2 hours |
| 2 points | ~4 hours |
| 3 points | ~6 hours |
| 5 points | ~10 hours (1.25 days) |
| 8 points | ~16 hours (2 days) |
| 13 points | ~26 hours (3.25 days) |
| 21 points | ~42 hours (5+ days) |

**Your Team's Velocity May Differ:**
- Junior developers: 1 point = 3-4 hours
- Senior developers: 1 point = 1.5-2 hours
- Team average: Track over time

---

## Confidence Levels

### High Confidence
- Requirements are clear
- Technology is familiar
- No major dependencies
- Standard patterns apply
- **Estimate:** ±20%

### Medium Confidence
- Some unclear requirements
- Some new technology
- Few external dependencies
- **Estimate:** ±40%

### Low Confidence
- Many unknowns
- New technology
- Many dependencies
- Unclear requirements
- **Recommendation:** Do spike/investigation first
- **Estimate:** ±60%+

## Common Estimation Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Estimating in Hours
**Problem:** Story points ≠ hours
**Solution:** Think in relative complexity, not time

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Over-Precision
**Problem:** Trying to estimate exactly
**Solution:** Use Fibonacci - embrace uncertainty

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Ignoring Unknowns
**Problem:** Estimating only known work
**Solution:** Add points for investigation/learning

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Not Breaking Down Large Tasks
**Problem:** 21+ point tasks
**Solution:** Break into smaller deliverables

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Individual Estimates
**Problem:** One person estimates
**Solution:** Team discussion (planning poker)

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Use Fibonacci scale consistently
- Consider all four components (effort, complexity, uncertainty, risk)
- Break down 13+ point tasks
- Track velocity over time
- Adjust estimates as you learn
- Use team consensus for estimates
- Include testing and review in estimate
- Document assumptions

### ❌ DON'T
- Don't treat story points as hours
- Don't estimate in isolation
- Don't ignore uncertainty
- Don't forget testing effort
- Don't rush estimation
- Don't compare developers by velocity
- Don't change scale mid-project

---

## Planning Poker (Team Estimation)

If working with a team:

1. **Present Task:** PM explains requirements
2. **Discussion:** Team asks clarifying questions
3. **Private Estimate:** Each member selects points (1,2,3,5,8,13,21)
4. **Reveal:** Everyone shows estimate simultaneously
5. **Discuss Differences:** Why highest/lowest?
6. **Re-estimate:** Repeat until consensus
7. **Record:** Document final estimate and assumptions

---

## Tracking & Improving

### Retrospective Questions
- Was estimate accurate?
- What did we miss?
- What caused variance?
- How can we improve?

### Metrics to Track
- Estimated vs. actual story points
- Velocity per sprint
- Confidence level accuracy
- Most common estimation errors

### Improving Estimates
- Review past similar tasks
- Document patterns
- Build estimation library
- Refine velocity over time

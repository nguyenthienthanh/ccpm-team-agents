# Voiceover Notifications System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Automatic voice notifications for approval gates and critical events
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27

---

## 🎯 Overview

Aura Frog now includes **automatic voiceover notifications** that alert you when your action is required during workflows. Never miss an approval gate again!

---

## ✨ Features

### Automatic Notifications

**1. Approval Gates (Stop Hook) - Context-Aware! 🎯**
- Triggers when Claude stops for approval
- **Intelligently reads conversation context**
- Auto-plays on macOS (afplay)
- Happens at every phase completion

**Example Messages:**
- Generic: "Hey, I need your input to continue."
- Phase 2: "Hey, Phase 2 - Design deliverables ready for review"
- Phase 5a: "Hey, Phase 5a approval needed"
- Tests: "Hey, All tests passed - review needed"
- Code Review: "Hey, Code review complete - approval needed"

**How It Works:**
- Reads the conversation transcript
- Extracts phase information and context
- Summarizes key points (under 15 words)
- Plays natural, context-aware message

**2. Critical Errors (Notification Hook)**
- Triggers on errors, failures, critical issues
- Plays audio: "Heads up, something went wrong. Check the error when you can."
- Helps catch problems immediately

## 🔧 Setup

### Prerequisites

**Required:**

```

**2. Add to Environment:**
```bash

## 🎙️ How It Works

### Approval Gate Flow (Context-Aware)

```
Workflow Phase Completes
  ↓
Claude shows approval gate
  ↓
Claude stops (waits for user input)
  ↓
Stop hook triggers automatically
  ↓
hooks/stop-voice-notify.sh is executed
  ↓
Read conversation transcript (JSON)
  ↓
Extract context:
  - Phase number (Phase 2, Phase 5a, etc.)
  - Deliverables type (design, tests, code review)
  - Status (passed, failed, complete)
  ↓
Summarize to under 15 words
  ↓
Call scripts/voice-notify.sh with context
  ↓
ElevenLabs API generates audio
  ↓
Audio saved to .claude/logs/audio/approval-gate_*.mp3
  ↓
Auto-plays (macOS: afplay)
  ↓
User hears: "Hey, Phase 2 - Design deliverables ready for review"
  ↓
Audio file deleted after playback
```

### Context Extraction Examples

**Transcript contains:** `"Phase 2: Design - Technical Architecture..."`
**Voiceover says:** "Hey, Phase 2 - Design deliverables ready for review"

**Transcript contains:** `"All tests pass. ✅ Ready for review"`
**Voiceover says:** "Hey, All tests passed - review needed"

**Transcript contains:** `"Code review complete. Please approve to continue."`
**Voiceover says:** "Hey, Code review complete - approval needed"

**No specific context found:**
**Voiceover says:** "Hey, I need your input to continue."

### Script: stop-voice-notify.sh (NEW!)

**Location:** `hooks/stop-voice-notify.sh`

**Purpose:** Context-aware hook that extracts approval context from conversation

**How It Works:**
1. Reads conversation transcript JSON from stdin
2. Extracts last assistant message
3. Parses phase information, deliverables, status
4. Summarizes to under 15 words
5. Calls `voice-notify.sh` with context

**Context Patterns Detected:**
- Phase numbers: `Phase 2`, `Phase 5a`, etc.
- Deliverables: `design`, `test plan`, `requirements`
- Test status: `tests pass`, `tests fail`
- Code review: `code review complete`

**Automatic Invocation:** Called by Stop hook in `hooks.json`

---

### Script: voice-notify.sh

**Location:** `scripts/voice-notify.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "Context message" "notification-type"
```

**Notification Types:**
- `approval-gate` - For approval gates
- `error` - For errors and failures
- `warning` - For warnings
- `completion` - For successful completions
- `general` - Generic notifications

**Examples:**
```bash
# Approval notification (generic)
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "" "approval-gate"
# → "Hey, I need your input to continue."

# Approval with context (from stop-voice-notify.sh)
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "Phase 2 approval needed" "approval-gate"
# → "Hey, Phase 2 approval needed"

bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "Design deliverables ready for review" "approval-gate"
# → "Hey, Design deliverables ready for review"

# Error notification
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "" "error"
# → "Heads up, something went wrong. Check the error when you can."

# Warning notification
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "" "warning"
# → "Just a heads up, you might want to check this."

# Completion notification
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "" "completion"
# → "All done! Task completed successfully."
```

**Note:**
- For `approval-gate` type: Context message is prefixed with "Hey, " automatically
- For other types: Fixed messages are used (context ignored)
- Keep context under 15 words for natural speech

### Adjust Voice Settings

Edit `scripts/voice-notify.sh` to customize:

```json
{
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.5,           // 0-1 (higher = more consistent)
    "similarity_boost": 0.75,   // 0-1 (higher = closer to original)
    "style": 0.0,               // 0-1 (exaggeration level)
    "use_speaker_boost": true   // Enhance clarity
  }
}
```

### Custom Messages

Edit `scripts/voice-notify.sh` case statement to change the natural messages:

```bash
case "$NOTIFICATION_TYPE" in
  "approval-gate")
    FULL_MESSAGE="Hey, I need your input to continue."
    ;;
  "error")
    FULL_MESSAGE="Heads up, something went wrong. Check the error when you can."
    ;;
  "custom-type")
    FULL_MESSAGE="Your custom message here."
    ;;
esac
```

**Tips for natural voiceover:**
- Keep it short (under 10 words)
- Use conversational language ("Hey" not "Attention please")
- Be friendly and casual
- Avoid robotic phrases like "Your approval is required"

## 🔕 Disable Voiceover

### Temporarily Disable

```bash
# Remove or comment out API key
# export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=""

# Script will gracefully skip if no API key
```

### Permanently Disable

**Option 1: Remove hooks**

Edit `hooks/hooks.json`, remove Stop and Notification hooks:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    // Remove "Stop" and "Notification" sections
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Disable in script**

Add to top of `scripts/voice-notify.sh`:
```bash
exit 0  # Always skip voiceover
```

## 🧹 Automatic Cleanup

**Voice files are automatically deleted after playback!**

### How It Works

**Immediate Deletion (macOS):**
- Audio plays synchronously (afplay waits for completion)
- File is deleted immediately after playback
- Zero disk usage
- No manual cleanup needed

**Example output:**
```
🔊 Generating voiceover...
✅ Voiceover generated
🔊 Playing notification...
🗑️  Audio file deleted after playback
```

**Non-macOS Platforms:**
- Files are saved to `.claude/logs/audio/`
- User needs to manually play and delete
- Use cleanup script for batch deletion

### Manual Cleanup (Non-macOS or Troubleshooting)

**If you need to clean up manually:**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/aurafrog/aura-frog
bash scripts/cleanup-voice.sh
```

**Example output:**
```
🧹 Aura Frog Voice File Cleanup
==========================

📊 Audio files statistics:
   Directory: .claude/logs/audio
   Total files: 5
   Total size: 150K

🔍 Finding files older than 7 days...
   Found 5 files

Delete 5 old audio files? (y/N) y

✅ Cleanup complete!
```

### Storage Impact

**macOS (Automatic deletion):**
- ✅ Zero disk usage
- ✅ Files deleted immediately after playback
- ✅ No manual maintenance

**Non-macOS:**
- Files accumulate in `.claude/logs/audio/`
- Use cleanup script periodically
- Each file ≈ 30KB

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No audio plays

**Check:**
1. API key set correctly: `echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
2. Script executable: `chmod +x scripts/voice-notify.sh`
3. ElevenLabs credits available: Check dashboard
4. Audio file created: `ls -la .claude/logs/audio/`

**macOS:** Verify afplay works: `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`

### Issue: "API key not configured"

```bash
# Verify environment variable
echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

# If empty, add to .envrc
echo 'export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key"' >> .envrc
direnv allow
```

### Issue: Script fails but workflow continues

**Expected behavior!** Voice notifications are non-blocking:
- Script uses `|| true` to never fail workflows
- If ElevenLabs unavailable, workflow continues silently
- Check `.claude/logs/audio/` for error logs

### Issue: Audio doesn't auto-play

**Platform-specific:**

**macOS:**
```bash
# Test afplay
afplay .claude/logs/audio/approval-gate_*.mp3
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install audio player
sudo apt-get install mpg123

# Edit voice-notify.sh, replace afplay with:
mpg123 "$OUTPUT_FILE" &
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Edit voice-notify.sh, replace afplay with:
start "$OUTPUT_FILE" &
```

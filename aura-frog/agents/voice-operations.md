## 🎙️ Use Cases

### 1. Documentation Narration (Primary Use Case)

**When:** After Phase 8 (Documentation) completion

**What:**
- Convert implementation summary to audio
- Narrate deployment guide
- Create audio onboarding for new features

**Example:**
```
Phase 8 Complete: Documentation Generated

Documentation files:
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (1,200 words)
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (800 words)

🎙️ Generate audio narration?
- "yes" → Generate MP3 narration
- "no" → Skip voice generation

If yes:
1. Read IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
2. Convert to natural speech using ElevenLabs
3. Save: .claude/logs/audio/workflow-123_implementation_summary.mp3
4. Upload to Confluence (optional)
5. Add audio player to documentation
```

**Benefits:**
- Accessibility for team members
- Easier onboarding (listen while coding)
- Multilingual support for international teams
- Hands-free documentation consumption

---

### 2. Workflow Notifications

**When:** Phase completion (if enabled in config)

**What:**
- Voice announcement: "Phase 2 Technical Planning completed. Awaiting approval."
- Voice prompt: "Please review the technical specification before proceeding."

**Example:**
```
Phase 5b Implementation Complete

Standard notification (Slack):
"✅ Phase 5b complete. All tests passing. Ready for code review."

Voice notification (if enabled):
[Plays audio]: "Implementation phase complete. All 42 tests are passing.
The code is ready for review. Please approve to proceed to code review phase."
```

---

### 3. Approval Gate Voice Prompts (✨ NEW - Automatic)

**When:** **AUTOMATICALLY** when Claude stops for approval (via Stop hook)

**What:**
- **Automatic voice notification** when user action is required
- Plays audio: "Your attention is needed"
- No configuration needed - works out of the box
- Gracefully skips if ElevenLabs not configured

**How It Works:**
```
1. Workflow reaches approval gate (Phase completion)
2. Claude stops and waits for user input
3. Stop hook triggers automatically
4. bash scripts/voice-notify.sh is executed
5. ElevenLabs generates audio: "Attention please. Your attention is needed. Your approval is required to continue."
6. Audio auto-plays (macOS: afplay)
7. User hears notification even if not watching screen
```

**Example:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
APPROVAL REQUIRED: Phase 4 Test Planning Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Summary: Created 28 unit tests and 12 integration tests...

[🔊 Playing voiceover...] → Automatic!
Audio: "Attention please. Your attention is needed. Your approval is required to continue."

Type "approve" or "reject"
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Never miss an approval gate
- ✅ Work on other tasks while workflow runs
- ✅ Accessibility for vision-impaired users
- ✅ Hands-free workflow monitoring
- ✅ Automatic - no commands needed

---

### 4. Error Alerts (Optional)

**When:** Critical errors or blockers occur

**What:**
- Voice alert for attention
- Useful in background workflows

**Example:**
```
[🔊 Voice Alert]: "Attention required. Test execution failed with 3 failing tests.
Please review the test results before continuing."
```

## 🔒 Safety & Privacy

### Data Handling

**ElevenLabs API:**
- Text is sent to ElevenLabs API for processing
- Audio is generated on ElevenLabs servers
- Downloaded and stored locally in `.claude/logs/audio/`
- No audio is stored on ElevenLabs servers after generation (API mode)

**⚠️ Important:**
- Do NOT narrate sensitive data (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- Review text before narration
- Audio files are stored locally - handle per company policy

### Approval Gates

**Before narrating:**
```
⚠️ PRIVACY CHECK

About to narrate:
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (1,245 words)
- Contains: code snippets, architecture details, API endpoints

Sensitive data detected:
- ⚠️ Internal API endpoints (sanitize?)
- ⚠️ Database schema details (sanitize?)

Options:
  "proceed" → Generate audio as-is
  "sanitize" → Remove sensitive details first
  "cancel" → Skip narration

Your choice:
```

---

## 📈 Success Criteria

- ✅ Audio generated clearly and naturally
- ✅ Pronunciation is accurate
- ✅ Emotional tone matches content
- ✅ File size is reasonable (<2 MB per 10 min)
- ✅ No sensitive data in narration

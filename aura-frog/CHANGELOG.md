## [5.2.0] - 2025-11-28 (Pre-Rebranding)

- Fixed version references (v5.0 → v5.2.0)
- Removed duplicate sections
- Condensed agent listings to reference

**Initial Skills Optimization (56% reduction):**

|-------|--------|-------|-----------|
| agent-detector | 304 | 89 | -71% |
| workflow-orchestrator | 253 | 92 | -64% |
| project-context-loader | 502 | 88 | -82% |

## [5.1.0] - 2025-11-27

### 🆕 Major Features

#### 1. Skills System

**8 Auto-Invoking Skills:**
1. **agent-detector** - ALWAYS runs first, selects appropriate specialized agent
2. **workflow-orchestrator** - Executes 9-phase workflow for complex features
3. **project-context-loader** - Loads project conventions before code generation
4. **bugfix-quick** - Fast bug fixes with TDD enforcement
5. **test-writer** - Comprehensive test creation (unit, integration, E2E)
6. **code-reviewer** - Multi-agent quality review (security, performance, quality)
7. **jira-integration** - Auto-fetches JIRA tickets when mentioned
8. **figma-integration** - Auto-extracts Figma designs when URLs shared

**How It Works:**
- Skills use **LLM reasoning** to match context
- Auto-invoke based on user intent (no manual commands)
- Multiple skills can activate for one message
- Natural language triggers: "implement", "fix bug", "add tests", "PROJ-1234", Figma URLs

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No command memorization needed
- ✅ Natural conversation ("fix the login bug" → bugfix-quick skill)
- ✅ Intelligent capability discovery
- ✅ Model-invoked (Claude decides when to use)
- ✅ Educational approach (skills inject detailed instructions)

**Plugin Configuration Enhanced:**
- **plugin.json** expanded to 382 lines
- Added agents registry (24 agents with priorities/types)
- Added commands registry (70 commands in 15 categories)
- Added workflows definitions (9-phase + quick-fix)
- Added rules registry (core + project)
- Added integrations config (JIRA, Figma, Slack, Confluence)
- Added templates and documentation references

**Dual-File Loader Architecture:**
- Project `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (loader) - tells Claude to read plugin
- Plugin `aura-frog/CLAUDE.md` (system) - contains ALL instructions
- Fixed issue where Claude didn't load Aura Frog without project CLAUDE.md
- `project:init` now creates lightweight loader file

**Changed:**
- CLAUDE.md version: 5.0.0-beta → 5.1.0
- Added Skills section to CLAUDE.md
- Updated README.md with Skills information
- Skills file naming: SKILL.md → descriptive names (workflow-execution.md, agent-selection.md, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Dramatically improved user experience (natural language vs commands)
- Better capability discovery (Skills auto-activate)
- Fixed critical loading issue (project CLAUDE.md loader)
- More maintainable plugin configuration

---

#### 2. Automatic Voiceover Notifications (✨ NEW)

**Added:**
- **scripts/voice-notify.sh** - ElevenLabs TTS integration script
- **Stop hook** - Automatic voiceover when approval needed

**How It Works:**
1. Workflow reaches approval gate
2. Claude stops for user approval
3. Stop hook triggers automatically
4. ElevenLabs generates audio: "Attention please. Your attention is needed. Your approval is required to continue."
5. Audio plays automatically
6. User hears notification even if not watching screen

## 🎯 Phase 6 Objectives

Cross-agent code review to ensure quality and best practices.

**Deliverables:**
1. Code Review Report
2. Issues Found (if any)
3. Recommendations
4. Quality Score

---

## 📋 Execution Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Phase Hook
- Load all implemented code from Phase 5
- Initialize review checklist
- Activate review agents

### Step 2: Multi-Agent Review

**Primary Reviewer:** Dev agent (mobile-react-native/web-*/backend-laravel)  
**Secondary Reviewers:** qa-automation, ui-designer, pm-orchestrator

Each agent reviews from their perspective:

#### Dev Agent Review
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Props/interfaces properly typed
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] No code smells
- [ ] DRY principle followed
- [ ] Proper component composition

#### QA Agent Review
- [ ] Test coverage adequate (≥85%)
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error scenarios tested
- [ ] Integration tests present
- [ ] Mock data appropriate

#### UI Designer Review
- [ ] Design tokens used correctly
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Accessibility labels present
- [ ] UI consistent with design system

### Step 3: Code Quality Checks

**Automated Checks:**
```bash
# 1. Linter
npm run lint
→ Must have: 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅

# 2. TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit
→ Must have: No type errors ✅

# 3. Tests
npm test
→ Must have: All tests passing ✅

# 4. Coverage
npm test -- --coverage
→ Must have: ≥85% coverage ✅

# 5. Code complexity (if tool available)
npm run complexity
→ Target: Complexity < 10 per function
```

### Step 4: Manual Code Review

Review for:

**Architecture:**
- Component boundaries clear?
- Proper separation of concerns?
- State management appropriate?
- Dependencies well-managed?

**Readability:**
- Code self-documenting?
- Comments where needed?
- Naming conventions followed?
- Consistent formatting?

**Performance:**
- Unnecessary re-renders avoided?
- Memoization used appropriately?
- No performance bottlenecks?
- Bundle size acceptable?

**Security:**
- No sensitive data exposed?
- Input validation present?
- API calls secure?
- No XSS vulnerabilities?

### Step 5: Generate Review Report

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "...",
  "current_phase": 2,  // Incremented
  "phases": {
    "1": {

## ⚠️ Validation

Before approving, command checks:
- [ ] Current phase is "completed" (not "in_progress" or "pending")
- [ ] Deliverables exist
- [ ] Success criteria met
- [ ] No blocking issues

If validation fails:
```
❌ Cannot approve: Phase not complete

Current status: in_progress
Missing: deliverables not generated

Please wait for phase to complete.
```

## 🎯 Auto-Execute Next Phase

After approval, automatically runs:
- Pre-phase hook (load context, verify prerequisites)
- Phase execution (agent work)
- Post-phase hook (validate, generate summary)
- Pre-approval hook (show approval gate)

User just needs to review and approve again.

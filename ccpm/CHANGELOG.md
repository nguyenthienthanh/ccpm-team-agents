# CCPM Team Agents System - Changelog

## [5.1.0] - 2025-11-27

### 🆕 Major Features

#### 1. Skills System

**8 Auto-Invoking Skills:**
1. **agent-detector** - ALWAYS runs first, selects appropriate specialized agent
2. **workflow-orchestrator** - Executes 9-phase workflow for complex features
3. **project-context-loader** - Loads project conventions before code generation
4. **bugfix-quick** - Fast bug fixes with TDD enforcement
5. **test-writer** - Comprehensive test creation (unit, integration, E2E)
6. **code-reviewer** - Multi-agent quality review (security, performance, quality)
7. **jira-integration** - Auto-fetches JIRA tickets when mentioned
8. **figma-integration** - Auto-extracts Figma designs when URLs shared

**How It Works:**
- Skills use **LLM reasoning** to match context
- Auto-invoke based on user intent (no manual commands)
- Multiple skills can activate for one message
- Natural language triggers: "implement", "fix bug", "add tests", "PROJ-1234", Figma URLs

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No command memorization needed
- ✅ Natural conversation ("fix the login bug" → bugfix-quick skill)
- ✅ Intelligent capability discovery
- ✅ Model-invoked (Claude decides when to use)
- ✅ Educational approach (skills inject detailed instructions)

**Plugin Configuration Enhanced:**
- **plugin.json** expanded to 382 lines
- Added agents registry (24 agents with priorities/types)
- Added commands registry (70 commands in 15 categories)
- Added workflows definitions (9-phase + quick-fix)
- Added rules registry (core + project)
- Added integrations config (JIRA, Figma, Slack, Confluence)
- Added templates and documentation references

**Dual-File Loader Architecture:**
- Project `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (loader) - tells Claude to read plugin
- Plugin `ccpm/CLAUDE.md` (system) - contains ALL instructions
- Fixed issue where Claude didn't load CCPM without project CLAUDE.md
- `project:init` now creates lightweight loader file

**Changed:**
- CLAUDE.md version: 5.0.0-beta → 5.1.0
- Added Skills section to CLAUDE.md
- Updated README.md with Skills information
- Skills file naming: SKILL.md → descriptive names (workflow-execution.md, agent-selection.md, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Dramatically improved user experience (natural language vs commands)
- Better capability discovery (Skills auto-activate)
- Fixed critical loading issue (project CLAUDE.md loader)
- More maintainable plugin configuration

#### 2. Automatic Voiceover Notifications (✨ NEW)

**Voice notifications for user action requirements**

**Added:**
- **scripts/voice-notify.sh** - ElevenLabs TTS integration script
- **Stop hook** - Automatic voiceover when approval needed
- **Notification hook** - Voice alerts for critical errors
- **Audio auto-play** - Plays notification sound (macOS: afplay)

**How It Works:**
1. Workflow reaches approval gate
2. Claude stops for user approval
3. Stop hook triggers automatically
4. ElevenLabs generates audio: "Attention please. Your attention is needed. Your approval is required to continue."
5. Audio plays automatically
6. User hears notification even if not watching screen

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Simple setup - just add API key
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key"

# Optional: Choose voice
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID="21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM"  # Rachel (default)
```

**Notification Types:**
- `approval-gate` - Phase completion, approval needed
- `error` - Critical errors and failures
- `warning` - Important warnings
- `completion` - Successful task completion
- `general` - Generic notifications

**Features:**
- ✅ **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box with API key
- ✅ **Non-blocking** - Gracefully skips if not configured
- ✅ **Auto-play** - Plays audio automatically (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ **Customizable voices** - 25+ ElevenLabs voices available
- ✅ **Multilingual** - 70+ languages supported
- ✅ **Cost-effective** - Free tier: 200 notifications/month

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Never miss an approval gate
- ✅ Work on other tasks while workflow runs
- ✅ Accessibility for vision-impaired users
- ✅ Hands-free workflow monitoring
- ✅ Multi-tasking friendly

**Files:**
- `scripts/voice-notify.sh` - TTS notification script
- `docs/VOICEOVER_NOTIFICATIONS.md` - Complete documentation
- `hooks/hooks.json` - Stop and Notification hooks
- `agents/voice-operations.md` - Updated with automatic notifications

#### 3. Hooks System

**7 Lifecycle Hooks:**
1. **SessionStart** - Welcome message, show available commands
2. **PreToolUse (Bash)** - Block dangerous commands (rm -rf, mkfs, etc.)
3. **PreToolUse (Write|Edit)** - Remind about project context
4. **PostToolUse (Bash)** - Log commands to .claude/logs/workflows/commands.log
5. **UserPromptSubmit** - Detect JIRA tickets and Figma URLs
6. **SessionEnd** - Suggest workflow:handoff if active workflow
7. **Stop** - Voiceover notification when approval needed (NEW)
8. **Notification** - Voice alerts for critical errors (NEW)

**Safety Features:**
- Blocks destructive bash commands
- Prevents accidental system damage
- Logs all command execution

**Workflow Helpers:**
- JIRA ticket detection (e.g., PROJ-1234)
- Figma URL detection (e.g., figma.com/file/...)
- Workflow handoff reminders
- Voice notifications for approval gates

## ✨ Features

### Automatic Notifications

**1. Approval Gates (Stop Hook)**

- Plays audio: "Attention please. Your attention is needed. Your approval is required to continue."
- Auto-plays on macOS (afplay)
- Happens at every phase completion

**2. Critical Errors (Notification Hook)**
- Triggers on errors, failures, critical issues
- Plays audio: "Alert. [error message]. Please review the error and provide guidance."
- Helps catch problems immediately

## 🎙️ How It Works

### Approval Gate Flow

```
Workflow Phase Completes
  ↓
Claude shows approval gate
  ↓
Claude stops (waits for user input)
  ↓
Stop hook triggers automatically
  ↓
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh is executed
  ↓
ElevenLabs API generates audio
  ↓
Audio saved to .claude/logs/audio/approval-gate_*.mp3
  ↓
Auto-plays (macOS: afplay)
  ↓
User hears "Your attention is needed"
```

### Script: voice-notify.sh

**Location:** `scripts/voice-notify.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "Message" "notification-type"
```

**Notification Types:**
- `approval-gate` - For approval gates
- `error` - For errors and failures
- `warning` - For warnings
- `completion` - For successful completions
- `general` - Generic notifications

**Examples:**
```bash
# Approval notification
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "Phase complete" "approval-gate"
# → "Attention please. Phase complete. Your approval is required to continue."

# Error notification
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "Build failed" "error"
# → "Alert. Build failed. Please review the error and provide guidance."

# Completion notification
bash scripts/voice-notify.sh "All tests passing" "completion"
# → "Great news. All tests passing. The task has been completed successfully."
```

### Adjust Voice Settings

Edit `scripts/voice-notify.sh` to customize:

```json
{
  "voice_settings": {
    "stability": 0.5,           // 0-1 (higher = more consistent)
    "similarity_boost": 0.75,   // 0-1 (higher = closer to original)
    "style": 0.0,               // 0-1 (exaggeration level)
    "use_speaker_boost": true   // Enhance clarity
  }
}
```

### Custom Messages

Edit `scripts/voice-notify.sh` case statement:

```bash
case "$NOTIFICATION_TYPE" in
  "approval-gate")
    FULL_MESSAGE="Attention please. $MESSAGE. Your approval is required to continue."
    ;;
  "custom-type")
    FULL_MESSAGE="Your custom prefix. $MESSAGE. Your custom suffix."
    ;;
esac
```

## 🔕 Disable Voiceover

### Temporarily Disable

```bash
# Remove or comment out API key
# export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=""

# Script will gracefully skip if no API key
```

### Permanently Disable

**Option 1: Remove hooks**

Edit `hooks/hooks.json`, remove Stop and Notification hooks:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    // Remove "Stop" and "Notification" sections
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Disable in script**

Add to top of `scripts/voice-notify.sh`:
```bash
exit 0  # Always skip voiceover
```

## 🎵 Audio Output

### File Location

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No audio plays

**Check:**
1. API key set correctly: `echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
2. Script executable: `chmod +x scripts/voice-notify.sh`
3. ElevenLabs credits available: Check dashboard
4. Audio file created: `ls -la .claude/logs/audio/`

**macOS:** Verify afplay works: `afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff`

### Issue: "API key not configured"

```bash
# Verify environment variable
echo $ELEVENLABS_API_KEY

# If empty, add to .envrc
echo 'export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_key"' >> .envrc
direnv allow
```

### Issue: Script fails but workflow continues

**Expected behavior!** Voice notifications are non-blocking:
- Script uses `|| true` to never fail workflows
- If ElevenLabs unavailable, workflow continues silently
- Check `.claude/logs/audio/` for error logs

### Issue: Audio doesn't auto-play

**Platform-specific:**

**macOS:**
```bash
# Test afplay
afplay .claude/logs/audio/approval-gate_*.mp3
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Install audio player
sudo apt-get install mpg123

# Edit voice-notify.sh, replace afplay with:
mpg123 "$OUTPUT_FILE" &
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Edit voice-notify.sh, replace afplay with:
start "$OUTPUT_FILE" &
```

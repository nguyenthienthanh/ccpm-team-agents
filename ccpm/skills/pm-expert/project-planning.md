### 3. Timeline Estimation

**Estimate effort for each task:**

**Estimation Techniques:**

1. **Story Points (Fibonacci):**
```
1 point = 2-4 hours (very simple)
2 points = 4-8 hours (simple)
3 points = 1-2 days (moderate)
5 points = 2-3 days (complex)
8 points = 3-5 days (very complex)
13 points = 1 week+ (needs breakdown)
```

2. **Three-Point Estimation:**
```
Estimate = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6

Example: ShareModal Component
Optimistic: 4 hours
Most Likely: 8 hours
Pessimistic: 16 hours

Estimate = (4 + 4×8 + 16) / 6 = 52 / 6 = 8.7 hours ≈ 1 day
```

**Estimation Table:**

```markdown
# Effort Estimates: Social Media Sharing

| Phase | Task | Estimate | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Requirements | 4h | HIGH | Clear scope |
| 2 | Tech Planning | 8h | HIGH | Similar to past features |
| 3 | Design Review | 4h | MEDIUM | Depends on design quality |
| 4 | Test Planning | 6h | HIGH | 53 test cases estimated |
| 5a | Write Tests | 8h | MEDIUM | Depends on complexity |
| 5b | Implementation | 32h | MEDIUM | 3-4 components + integration |
| 5c | Refactoring | 4h | HIGH | Code optimization |
| 6 | Code Review | 4h | HIGH | Standard process |
| 7 | QA Validation | 8h | MEDIUM | Depends on bug count |
| 8 | Documentation | 4h | HIGH | Templates available |
| 9 | Notification | 1h | HIGH | Automated |

**Total Effort:** 83 hours (10.4 days)
**Buffer (20%):** +17 hours (2.1 days)
**Final Estimate:** 100 hours (12.5 days ~ 2.5 weeks)
```

### 4. Schedule Development

**Create project timeline:**

```markdown
# Project Schedule: PROJ-1234

```

### 5. Resource Planning

**Allocate resources effectively:**

```markdown
# Resource Plan

## Team Composition
- **Frontend Developer (Mobile):** 100% allocated (2.5 weeks)
- **QA Engineer:** 40% allocated (testing phase only)
- **UI Designer:** 10% allocated (design review only)
- **Backend Developer:** 0% (API already exists)
- **PM:** 20% allocated (coordination)

## Resource Availability
| Resource | Availability | Vacation | Capacity |
|----------|--------------|----------|----------|
| Dev 1 (Mobile) | 100% | None | 40h/week |
| QA Engineer | 40% | None | 16h/week |
| UI Designer | 10% | None | 4h/week |

## Resource Allocation by Phase
```mermaid
gantt
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Resources
    Frontend Dev    :2025-01-01, 12d
    QA Engineer     :2025-01-08, 5d
    UI Designer     :2025-01-02, 1d
```

## Skill Requirements
- ✅ React Native (Required) - Dev 1 ✅
- ✅ TypeScript (Required) - Dev 1 ✅
- ✅ Jest/Testing (Required) - Dev 1 ✅, QA ✅
- ✅ Social Media APIs (Nice to have) - Dev 1 can learn
- ✅ Figma (Required) - UI Designer ✅
```

### 6. Critical Path Analysis

**Identify critical path:**

```markdown
# Critical Path: Social Media Sharing

## Critical Tasks (Cannot be delayed)
1. Phase 1: Requirements (4h) → START
2. Phase 2: Tech Planning (8h) → depends on Phase 1
3. Phase 4: Test Planning (6h) → depends on Phase 2
4. Phase 5a: Write Tests (8h) → depends on Phase 4
5. Phase 5b: Implementation (32h) → depends on Phase 5a
6. Phase 7: QA Validation (8h) → depends on Phase 5b
7. END

**Critical Path Duration:** 66 hours (8.25 days)
**Project Duration:** 100 hours (12.5 days)
**Float:** 34 hours (4.25 days)

## Non-Critical Tasks (Have slack)
- Phase 3: Design Review (can parallel with Phase 4)
- Phase 5c: Refactoring (can adjust if needed)
- Phase 6: Code Review (can overlap with QA)
- Phase 8: Documentation (can parallel with Phase 7)

## Impact of Delays
- 1 day delay in critical path → 1 day project delay
- 1 day delay in non-critical → No project impact (if within float)
```

### 7. Risk and Buffer Management

**Plan for uncertainties:**

```markdown
# Buffer Strategy

## Time Buffers
- **Task Buffers:** Included in estimates (worst case)
- **Phase Buffer:** 20% of phase duration
- **Project Buffer:** 3 days at end

## Buffer Consumption Monitoring
Week 1: Expected 25% buffer used
Week 2: Expected 50% buffer used  
Week 3: Expected 75% buffer used

If >50% buffer consumed early → Red flag!

## Risk Mitigation in Schedule
- High-risk tasks: Add 30% buffer
- Medium-risk tasks: Add 20% buffer
- Low-risk tasks: Add 10% buffer

## Example: Implementation Phase (High Risk)
- Base estimate: 32h
- Risk buffer: +9.6h (30%)
- Total scheduled: 42h (rounded to 2 weeks)
```

### 8. Progress Tracking

**Monitor project progress:**

```markdown
# Progress Dashboard

## Overall Status
**Completion:** 44% (Phase 4 of 9 complete)
**Timeline:** ON TRACK ✅
**Budget:** WITHIN BUDGET ✅
**Quality:** ON TARGET ✅

## Phase Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Requirements (100% - APPROVED)
- ✅ Phase 2: Technical Planning (100% - APPROVED)
- ✅ Phase 3: Design Review (100% - APPROVED)
- 🔄 Phase 4: Test Planning (80% - IN PROGRESS)
- ⏸️ Phase 5-9: Not started

## Velocity Tracking
**Planned velocity:** 40h/week
**Actual velocity:** 38h/week (Week 1)
**Efficiency:** 95% (good)

## Earned Value Analysis
**Planned Value (PV):** 40 hours
**Earned Value (EV):** 38 hours  
**Actual Cost (AC):** 40 hours

**Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** 0.95 (slightly behind)
**Cost Performance Index (CPI):** 0.95 (slightly over budget)

**Interpretation:** Minor delay, course correction needed
```

### 9. Change Management

**Handle scope/schedule changes:**

```markdown
# Change Control Process

## Change Request Form

**CR-001: Add Video Support**

**Requested By:** Product Manager

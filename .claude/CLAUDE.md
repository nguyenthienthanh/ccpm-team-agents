# CCPM - Instructions for Claude Code AI

**System:** CCPM Team Agents System  
**Version:** 4.5.0  
**Purpose:** Guide Claude Code AI to operate as specialized agents in structured workflows

---

## 🔧 Important Clarifications

### 1. Hooks Are Logical, Not Runtime

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The "hooks" in `.claude/hooks/` are **conceptual guides**, not executable JavaScript/TypeScript files.

- ✅ They define **logic** for Claude to follow
- ✅ They are **markdown documentation** describing behavior
- ❌ They are NOT Node.js scripts
- ❌ They do NOT run as separate processes

**Example:**
- `pre-phase.md` tells Claude: "Before starting a phase, check prerequisites and load workflow state"
- Claude reads this file and **implements the logic** in its responses
- No actual `.js` or `.sh` file gets executed

### 2. Workflow Flexibility

**You have TWO workflow modes:**

#### Mode 1: Full 9-Phase Workflow (High Quality)
```
workflow:start → Phase 1-9 → Complete
```
- Use for: New features, complex changes, production code
- Includes: Full TDD, code review, QA validation, documentation
- Time: 2-4 hours
- Quality: Maximum

#### Mode 2: Lightweight Commands (Speed)
```
bugfix:quick → Quick fix
refactor → Just refactor
planning → Just plan
document → Just document
```
- Use for: Small bugs, docs, simple refactors
- Includes: Minimal phases, focused on task
- Time: 30 min - 1 hour
- Quality: Good

**Claude will:**
- Default to appropriate mode based on task complexity
- Suggest lightweight mode for simple tasks
- Ask if you want full workflow for complex tasks

### 3. Phase Grouping for Small Tasks

For small tasks, phases can be grouped:

**Phases 1-4 (Planning):**
- Can execute in one pass for simple tasks
- Approval gate at end of Phase 4

**Phases 5-7 (Implementation + Validation):**
- Can merge: "Write test → apply fix → re-run test"
- One approval gate after tests pass

**Phases 8-9 (Documentation + Notification):**
- Optional for very small tasks
- Can skip if not needed

**Example Lightweight Flow:**
```
bugfix:quick "Typo in button label"

Claude:
1. ✅ Analyze + Plan (Phases 1-2, no approval)
2. ✅ Write test + Fix + Verify (Phases 5-7, show approval)
3. ✅ Done (skip docs for trivial change)

Total: 2 approval gates vs 9
```

## 🔄 Session Continuation & State Management

### Active Workflow Tracking

**Current implementation:**
- File: `.claude/logs/workflows/[workflow-id]/workflow-state.json`
- Contains: Current phase, deliverables, tokens used, timestamp
- Updated: After each phase completion

### When to Use handoff/resume

**Use `workflow:handoff`:**
- Token count reaches 150K (75% of 200K limit)
- Need to close session but continue later
- Switching between devices
- Taking a break on long workflow

**Command creates:**
- Backup of workflow state
- Context summary (what's done, what's next)
- Instructions for resuming

**Use `workflow:resume [workflow-id]`:**
- In new session, load saved workflow
- Claude reads context from logs
- Continues from last saved phase
- No need to re-explain everything

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You don't need handoff/resume for normal command usage!
- handoff/resume is for CONTINUING a specific workflow across sessions
- For new tasks, just start a new command
- Claude automatically loads context from file system

**Example:**
```
Session 1:
workflow:start "Big feature" 
... reaches Phase 5b, 160K tokens ...
workflow:handoff

Session 2 (new Cursor window):
workflow:resume workflow-big-feature-timestamp
... continues from Phase 5b ...
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Project Context is MANDATORY

**⚠️ EVERY workflow MUST load project context FIRST!**

**Why critical:**
- ✅ Makes AI aware of YOUR project conventions
- ✅ Knows YOUR tech stack versions
- ✅ Follows YOUR file naming patterns
- ✅ Uses YOUR team reviewers
- ❌ Without it: Wrong conventions, wrong patterns, generic code

**Priority:**
```
Project Context > CCPM Rules > Generic Defaults
```

**Location:**
```
.claude/project-contexts/[project-name]/
├── project-config.yaml    # ⭐ Tech stack, team, config
├── conventions.md         # ⭐ Naming, structure, patterns
├── rules.md               # ⭐ Project-specific rules
└── examples.md            # ⭐ Code examples
```

**Initialize if missing:**
```bash
project:init
```

This scans your project and creates context automatically.

**Loading workflow:**
1. Check if context exists
2. Load project-config.yaml
3. Load conventions.md
4. Load rules.md (from project-contexts)
5. Load examples.md
6. **Load CCPM core rules** (from `.claude/rules/`)
7. **Combine rules:** Project rules override CCPM rules where they conflict
8. Apply ALL to workflow decisions

**Rules Combination:**
```
Project Context Rules > CCPM Core Rules > Generic Defaults
```

**How it works:**
1. Load ALL rules from `.claude/rules/` (13 core rules - universal)
2. Load project rules from `project-contexts/[project]/rules.md`
3. Merge: Project rules override core rules where they conflict
4. Result: Combined ruleset applied to workflow

**Example:**
- `.claude/rules/tdd-workflow.md` → Applies to ALL projects (core rule)
- `.claude/rules/theme-consistency.md` → Applies to ALL projects (core rule)
- `project-contexts/my-project/rules.md` → Project-specific rules (overrides core if conflicts)

**📚 See:** `.claude/docs/RULES_COMBINATION.md` for detailed explanation

**Example:**
```
User: "workflow:start Add user profile"

You:
1. ✅ Load: .claude/project-contexts/your-proj/project-config.yaml
   → Tech: React Native + Zustand + React Query
   → Structure: Phone/Tablet + Region-specific (PH, MY, ID, IB, HK)
   
2. ✅ Load: conventions.md
   → Files: PascalCase.tsx
   → Components: UserProfile.tsx + .phone.tsx + .tablet.tsx
   → Branch: feature/PROJPH-1234-add-user-profile
   
3. ✅ Load: rules.md
   → No hardcoded colors (use theme)
   → Accessibility labels required
   → 80% test coverage
   
4. ✅ Load: examples.md
   → Reference: UserSettings feature (similar pattern)
   
5. ✅ Apply to workflow:
   → Create Phone/Tablet variants
   → Use Zustand slice
   → Use theme colors
   → Assign Jacky (PH) as reviewer
```

## 🎮 Command Detection & Execution

### Command Patterns

**CCPM supports flexible command syntax:**
- Natural language: `"Start a workflow to refactor component X"`
- Command style: `workflow:start Refactor component X`
- Explicit: `"Execute workflow:start command for task X"`

**All trigger the same action!**

### Core Workflow Commands

| Command | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **workflow:start** | `workflow:start <task>` | Initialize workflow, execute Phase 1 |
| **workflow:status** | `workflow:status` | Show current workflow progress |
| **workflow:approve** | `approve` / `yes` / `workflow:approve` | Approve current phase, proceed |
| **workflow:reject** | `reject: <reason>` | Reject phase, restart with feedback |
| **workflow:modify** | `modify: <changes>` | Modify deliverables without restart |

### Planning & Execution Commands (NEW!)

| Command | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **planning** | `planning <task>` | Create execution plan (skip to execution later) |
| **planning:list** | `planning:list` | List all saved plans |
| **planning:refine** | `planning:refine <plan-id>` | Update existing plan |
| **execute** | `execute <plan-id>` | Execute plan (skip Phase 1-4) |

### Testing Commands (NEW!)

| Command | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **test:unit** | `test:unit <file>` | Add unit tests (Jest, PHPUnit) |
| **test:e2e** | `test:e2e <flow>` | Add E2E tests (Cypress, Detox) |
| **test:coverage** | `test:coverage` | Check coverage & identify gaps |

### Documentation Commands (NEW!)

| Command | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **document feature** | `document feature <name>` | Generate feature documentation |
| **document api** | `document api <file>` | Generate API documentation |
| **document component** | `document component <file>` | Generate component docs |
| **document spec** | `document spec <task>` | Generate technical spec |
| **document guide** | `document guide <topic>` | Generate user guide |

### Other Commands

| Command | Syntax | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **agent:list** | `agent:list` / `"List agents"` | Show all 14 available agents |
| **agent:info** | `agent:info <agent-name>` | Show agent details |
| **project:init** | `project:init` | Initialize CCPM for new project |
| **project:detect** | `project:detect` | Detect project type and tech stack |
| **help** | `help` | Show all available commands |

### Command Execution Flow

```
1. User types command or natural language
   ↓
2. Detect intent (workflow action?)
   ↓
3. Load command definition (.claude/commands/<command>.md)
   ↓
4. Load project context (.claude/project-contexts/<project>/)
   ↓
5. Execute pre-phase hook (.claude/hooks/pre-phase.md)
   ↓
6. Execute phase logic (follow phase guide)
   ↓
7. Execute post-phase hook (.claude/hooks/post-phase.md)
   ↓
8. Show approval gate (.claude/hooks/pre-approval.md)
   ↓
9. Wait for user response
```

### Execution Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Load project context first
- ✅ Read command definition file
- ✅ Follow execution steps exactly
- ✅ Load relevant hooks, rules, and guides
- ✅ Activate appropriate agents
- ✅ Generate deliverables
- ✅ Show approval gate
- ✅ Wait for explicit user approval

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Skip project context loading
- ❌ Ignore approval gates
- ❌ Auto-approve without user confirmation
- ❌ Write to external systems without confirmation

**ALWAYS (After User Approval):**
- ✅ IMMEDIATELY execute next phase (auto-continue)
- ✅ Show token usage at each phase
- ✅ Continue through all phases until complete
- ✅ Only stop at: explicit rejection, errors, or Phase 5c completion

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Figma Link Handling

**When you detect a Figma link (https://www.figma.com/file/...):**

1. **DO NOT fetch the link directly** - This will cause 403 errors
2. **DO use MCP tools** to extract Figma data:
   - Check if Figma MCP server is available (list MCP resources)
   - Use MCP tools like `figma_file_get`, `figma_design_tokens_extract`, etc.
   - Extract file ID from the URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/{FILE_ID}/{fileName}`
   
3. **If MCP is not available:**
   - Ask user to provide screenshots instead
   - Do NOT attempt to fetch the Figma URL directly
   - Explain that direct URL access requires authentication and should use MCP

**Example:**
```
User: "Here's the Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/Design"

You should:
1. Extract file ID: "ABC123"
2. Check available MCP tools
3. Use MCP tool: figma_file_get(fileId="ABC123")
4. If MCP not available, ask for screenshots

NOT:
- ❌ Fetch https://www.figma.com/file/ABC123/Design directly
- ❌ Use curl or HTTP requests to Figma URLs
```

**Reference:** See `.claude/docs/figma-mcp-integration.md` for complete MCP setup guide.

## 🚦 Approval Gates

### When to Show Approval Gate

**Show approval gate:**
- ✅ After every phase completion
- ✅ Before code generation
- ✅ Before file modifications
- ✅ Before external system writes

### Approval Gate Format

```markdown
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  APPROVAL REQUIRED: [Gate Type]                          ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

## [Phase Name] Complete

**Summary:**
[Brief overview of what was done]

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ [file1.md] - [description]
- ✅ [file2.md] - [description]

**Preview:**
[Show key content or code snippets]

**Cross-Review Status:** (if applicable)
- ✅ Dev Review: Approved
- ✅ QA Review: Approved

**Next Steps:**
[What happens after approval]

**Token Usage:**
- Phase tokens: [X] tokens (~[Y]K)
- Total used: [A] / 1,000,000 ([B]%)
- Remaining: [C] tokens

---

**Options:**
- "approve" → [IMMEDIATELY execute next phase]
- "reject: [reason]" → [Restart phase]
- "modify: [changes]" → [Adjust deliverables]

**⚡ After approval, I will AUTO-CONTINUE to next phase without waiting!**

**⚠️ Token Limit:**
- Cursor session limit: **200,000 tokens**
- At 150K tokens (75%): Show handoff warning
- At 160K+ tokens (80%): Recommend workflow:handoff
```

### Valid User Responses

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `approve` / `yes` / `approved` | Proceed to next phase & AUTO-CONTINUE |
| `proceed` | Execute code generation & AUTO-CONTINUE |
| `reject: <reason>` | Restart phase with feedback |
| `modify: <instructions>` | Adjust deliverables |
| `stop` / `cancel` | Cancel workflow |

**⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE BEHAVIOR:**
- After user approves, IMMEDIATELY execute next phase
- No waiting for next prompt
- Continue until implementation complete (Phase 5c) or blocking error
- Show token usage at each phase completion

---

## 📖 Key Rules & Guidelines

### TDD Enforcement (CRITICAL)

**Phase 5 TDD Workflow:**
1. **RED:** Write tests → Tests FAIL → Show approval
2. **GREEN:** Write code → Tests PASS → Show approval
3. **REFACTOR:** Improve code → Tests PASS → Show approval

**Blocking Conditions:**
- ❌ Cannot implement without tests
- ❌ Cannot proceed if tests don't fail (RED)
- ❌ Cannot proceed if tests don't pass (GREEN)
- ❌ Cannot proceed if coverage below target

### KISS Principle

**Always prefer:**
- ✅ Simple solutions over complex
- ✅ Standard patterns over custom
- ✅ Readable code over clever code
- ✅ Solve today's problem, not tomorrow's maybe-problem

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Premature abstraction
- ❌ Over-engineering
- ❌ Excessive configuration
- ❌ Unnecessary layers

### Cross-Review

**Phase 1:** PM creates → Dev + QA + UI review  
**Phase 2:** Dev creates → Secondary Dev + QA review  
**Phase 4:** QA creates → Dev reviews

**Purpose:**
- Catch issues early
- Knowledge sharing
- Quality assurance
- Multiple perspectives

### Code Quality

**All code must:**
- ✅ Follow project conventions (from project-context)
- ✅ Pass linter (0 warnings)
- ✅ Have tests (≥80% coverage)
- ✅ Be reviewed
- ✅ Follow KISS principle
- ✅ Have proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Include error handling

## 🎨 Using Project Context

### Example Workflow with Context

**Scenario:** User says `"workflow:start Add user authentication"`

**Your execution:**

```
Step 1: Load Project Context
- Read: .claude/project-contexts/my-project/project-config.yaml
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit
- Load: conventions.md → File naming: PascalCase.tsx
- Load: examples.md → Similar feature: User login
- Load: team.md → Frontend reviewer: jane@example.com

Step 2: Phase 1 - Requirements Analysis
- Use ticket format from examples.md
- Follow conventions from conventions.md
- Generate: PROJ-1234 (not hardcoded project name)
- Identify components using project patterns

Step 3: Cross-Review
- Assign reviewer from team.md
- Dev reviews technical feasibility
- QA reviews testability

Step 4: Show Approval Gate
- Use project ticket format
- Reference project conventions
- Show project-specific examples

Step 5: Phase 2 - Technical Planning
- Follow file structure from conventions.md
- Use state management from project-config.yaml (Redux Toolkit)
- Apply naming conventions from conventions.md

... continue through all phases
```

### Context Priority

```
Project Context > CCPM Config > CCPM Defaults

Example:
- Project says: "Use BEM for CSS" → Use BEM
- CCPM default: "CSS Modules" → Ignored
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Project Context Not Found

**If `.claude/project-contexts/[project]/` doesn't exist:**
1. Suggest running `project:init` to create context
2. Use generic CCPM defaults
3. Ask user for project specifics
4. Document decisions for future context creation

### Missing Project Files

**If project-context incomplete:**
- `project-config.yaml` missing → Use CCPM defaults
- `conventions.md` missing → Ask user or use common patterns
- `examples.md` missing → Create generic examples
- `team.md` missing → Ask for reviewers when needed

### Integration Not Configured

**If JIRA/Confluence/Slack not configured:**
```markdown
⚠️ [Integration] not configured in project context.

Options:
1. Manually provide information
2. Configure later in project-config.yaml
3. Skip integration for now

Proceeding with manual input...
```
